3분 딥러닝 파이토지맛 (3-minute deep learning Pytorch )
A weeks ago my professor recommended  me to read a book called 3분 딥러닝 파이토지맛 (3-minute deep learning Pytorch ) ,
the book will cover how to create a neural network and deep learning systems with Pytorch , the book quickly gets you to work building a real world examples & it covers best practices for the entire DL piplelines including PyTorch Tensors, Neural networks(신경망),CNN,DNN,Autoenocers,RNN , loading data in Python, monitoring training, and visualizing results, here is my practical code of the book !
